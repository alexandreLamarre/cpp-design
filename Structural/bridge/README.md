### Bridge

- Bridge prevents a 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion
- Bridge pattern avoids entity explosion
- A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy)


### Summary 
- Decouple abstraction from implementation
- Both can exist as hierarchies
- A stronger form of encapsulation
