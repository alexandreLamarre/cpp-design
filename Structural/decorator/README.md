### Decorator

- Want to augment an object with additional functionality
- Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP)
- Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP)
- Need to be able to interact with existing structures
- Two options:
  - Aggregate the decorated object
  - Inherit the decorated object
